# -Global-Health-Expenditure-Forecasting

This project investigates the multifaceted dynamics of global health expenditure, analyzing the intricate interplay of economic growth, demographic transitions, technological advancements, and critically, geopolitical risks. By combining data from the Global Health Expenditure Database (GHED) with geopolitical risk indicators, this study examines how these factors collectively shape healthcare spending worldwide. Employing a blend of econometric analysis and advanced machine learning techniques, particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, the project forecasts future health expenditure trends, with a specific focus on understanding and mitigating disparities between high-income countries and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).

The research explores how economic robustness, demographic shifts (including aging populations and the rising burden of non-communicable diseases), and technological innovation influence healthcare resource allocation. Notably, it highlights the impact of geopolitical instability and risk on healthcare systems, particularly in vulnerable regions. High-income countries, with their stable economic frameworks and advanced infrastructure, are contrasted with LMICs, which often face fiscal constraints, systemic inefficiencies, and heightened vulnerability to geopolitical events.

A core component of this project is the application of LSTM models to forecast long-term expenditure trends, revealing the volatility and non-linear patterns prevalent in LMIC contexts, often exacerbated by geopolitical uncertainties. These forecasts provide critical insights for policymakers, emphasizing the urgent need for data-driven strategies that prioritize primary healthcare, cost-effective interventions, and resilience against external shocks.

The study's findings have profound implications for both policymakers and academia. It advocates for innovative health financing mechanisms, strategic policy-making informed by forecasting models that incorporate geopolitical risks, and the integration of digital health technologies to achieve universal health coverage (UHC). For academia, this research contributes to the global health expenditure discourse by integrating advanced analytical techniques and highlighting the necessity of interdisciplinary research that explores the nexus of economic, epidemiological, geopolitical, and policy factors.

Acknowledging the study's limitations, including data variability, gaps in LMIC data, and the exclusion of certain qualitative variables, this project calls for future research to address these gaps and advance methodologies for more holistic analyses. By providing a comprehensive understanding of global health expenditure dynamics, especially in the context of geopolitical risks, this project aims to inform evidence-based policymaking and contribute to the pursuit of global health equity.
